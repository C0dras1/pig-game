GAME RULES:
  1. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he/she whishes. Each result get added to his/her ROUND score.
  2. BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his/her ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
  3. The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
  4. A player loses their ENTIRE score if they roll two 6's in a row on either die.
  5. The first player to reach the set points on GLOBAL score wins the game."
